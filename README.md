# name-validation
Function that will take a full name and return whether the given name is a valid name or not.
The code was tested with all the files in the folder datasets.

NOTE:
Few names in the Olympic Atheletes dataset had a '?' symbol in the middle of the names. I'm assuming these are errors that happened when the data was acquired.
